CLASSES
    builtins.object
        Reports

    class Reports(builtins.object)
     |  Reports(token)
     |
     |  Simple library to use the Power BI api and obtain reports from it.
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, token)
     |      Create a simplePBI object to request admin API
     |      Args:
     |          token: String
     |              Bearer Token to use the Power Bi Rest API
     |
     |  clone_report(self, report_id, name, target_dataset_id=None, target_workspace_id=None)
     |      Clones the specified report from "My Workspace".
     |      If after cloning the report and its dataset reside in two different upgraded workspaces or "My Workspace", a shared dataset will be created in the report's workspace.
     |      Reports with live connection will lose the live connection when cloning, and will have a direct binding to the target dataset.
     |      ### Parameters
     |      ----
     |      report_id: str uuid
     |          The Power Bi report id. You can take it from PBI Service URL
     |      ### Request Body
     |      ----
     |      name: str
     |          The new report name
     |      target_dataset_id: str uuid
     |          (Optional) Parameter for specifying the target associated dataset ID. If not provided, the new report will be associated with the same dataset as the source report.
     |      target_workspace_id: str uuid
     |          (Optional) Parameter for specifying the target workspace ID. An empty GUID (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) indicates My workspace. If this parameter isn't provided, the new report will be cloned within the same workspace as the source report.
     |      ### Returns
     |      ----
     |      Response object from requests library. 200 OK
     |
     |  clone_report_in_group(self, workspace_id, report_id, name, target_dataset_id=None, target_workspace_id=None)

     |      If after cloning the report and its dataset reside in two different upgraded workspaces or "My Workspace", a shared dataset will be created in the report's workspace.
     |      Reports with live connection will lose the live connection when cloning, and will have a direct binding to the target dataset.
